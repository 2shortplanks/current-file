# Current File

Plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) that allows external programs to
determine what the current file you're looking at in the the desktop
application.

## Why?

One of the great things about Obsidian is that it just works on a directory
of Markdown (an "Obsidian Vault").  You can manipulate the contents of the files
with external programs while Obsidian is open and it'll reflect the changes in
the application.  You're not bound to Obsidian and can use any tools you want
in your workflow.

This plugin allows external programs to be able to determine what file you're
looking at in the Obsidian desktop application.  For example, you could bind a
keyboard shortcut to execute a Perl script to add the path to the current note
to your daily note. You could have a Go program that checks if every link in the
current file is still reachable and removes those that are not.  The
possibilities are endless.

## How to use this plugin

By default every time Obsidian starts looking at a new file in a vault that has
this plugin installed, a JSON file will be written to
`.obsidian-current-file.json` in your home directory (or current profile directory
on Windows))

```json
{
    "file": "Sorted/Daily/2024-07-19.md",
    "vault": "/Users/markfowler/Obsidian/MyVault",
    "fullpath": "/Users/markfowler/Obsidian/MyVault/Sorted/Daily/2024-07-19.md"
}
```

You can change where the file will be written to in the settings for this plugin.

## Alternatives

Obsidian natively supports a x-callback-url scheme to allow you to determine
what file it's looking at, although this requires you to be running an
application with a custom url scheme to receive the information (or be running a
webserver and not mind having Obsidian spawn a web browser window).

More information on this feature can be found in the
[Obsidian Help Documentation](https://help.obsidian.md/Extending+Obsidian/Obsidian+URI#Integrate+with+Hook).
